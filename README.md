# Professional Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing Report - Typhoon Machine

## Overview

This repository contains a **professional-grade** Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) report conducted on the **Typhoon machine**, a VulnHub virtual machine designed for cybersecurity training. The report follows industry-standard methodologies and frameworks such as **NIST SP 800-115**, **OWASP Top 10**, and **CVSS 3.1**, showcasing **penetration testing expertise** and **report writing skills**.

## Objectives

- Identify vulnerabilities in web applications, databases, and network services.
- Assess the effectiveness of security controls.
- Perform **exploitation and post-exploitation** analysis.
- Provide **detailed remediation recommendations** for each vulnerability.

## Key Findings

- **15 vulnerabilities discovered**, categorized as:
  - **9 Critical** (e.g., Drupal EOL, SambaCry, Apache Tomcat Weak Credentials)
  - **3 High** (e.g., NFS Misconfigurations, SMB Signing Disabled)
  - **3 Medium** (e.g., Apache Tomcat Default Files, Lotus CMS Vulnerabilities)
- **Attack Techniques Used**:
  - Brute force attacks (FTP, SSH, PostgreSQL)
  - Exploitation of outdated software (Drupal, Lotus CMS, Samba)
  - Configuration flaws (NFS, Redis, SMB Signing)
  - **Post-exploitation activities**, including privilege escalation and data exfiltration.

## Methodology

The penetration testing followed the **NIST SP 800-115 framework**:

1. **Planning** - Defined scope, objectives, and rules of engagement.
2. **Discovery** - Used **Nmap, Nessus**, and manual enumeration to identify vulnerabilities.
3. **Exploitation** - Leveraged **Metasploit, manual exploits, and custom scripts** to validate findings.
4. **Reporting** - Documented **technical details, impact analysis, and remediation steps** in a structured report.

## Tools Used

- **Nmap** - Network scanning and service enumeration.
- **Nessus** - Automated vulnerability assessment.
- **Metasploit** - Exploitation framework.
- **Burp Suite** - Web application testing.
- **Hydra** - Brute-force attacks.
- **Manual exploitation** - Custom scripts and techniques.

## Report Structure

The full **Professional VAPT Report** includes:

1. **Assessment Overview** - Scope, methodology, and objectives.
2. **Findings & Severity Ratings** - Details of vulnerabilities, CVSS scores, and impact analysis.
3. **Exploitation Proof-of-Concept (PoC)** - Screenshots and technical evidence of successful exploits.
4. **Countermeasures & Recommendations** - Actionable steps to mitigate vulnerabilities.
5. **Conclusion** - Final security posture evaluation and recommendations.

## Why This Matters

This project demonstrates my ability to conduct **comprehensive penetration tests**, **exploit real-world vulnerabilities**, and **deliver professional reports**â€”critical skills for a **Cybersecurity Specialist** role. It highlights the proficiency in:

- **Security assessment methodologies**
- **Network & application penetration testing**
- **Risk analysis & mitigation planning**
- **Technical documentation & reporting**
